					<h2>THE PRINCIPLE</h2>
					<p>
						To cope with the current ecological crisis, thrift stores are becoming more and more frequent. It's about selling second-hand, which reduces the textile industry, which is the second most polluting in the world. Thus, giving a second life to the items we sell online reconciles respect for the environment and an adaptation to technological advances.

					<p>
						"I'm Hippolyte Boranian and I am a student at IESEG, a business school.
						Passionate about fashion, it is with interest for this field that I am thinking of moving towards a master's degree in luxury marketing.
						I was born in a time when many young people are trying to fight global warming. Consequently, the idea of this online thrift store seemed obvious to me."
